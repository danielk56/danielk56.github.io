    <span class="home-title">Hi! I'm <span class="green">Daniel</span> ðŸ‘‹</span>
    <span class="home-subtitle">Iâ€™m a junior at Yale studying <span class="green">statistics and data science</span>. 

        <p class="home-blurb">This summer, I'm a <strong>data science intern at</strong>  [Cherish](https://www.hellocherish.com/){:target="_blank" class="button inline-label-page"}, working on content matching algorithms.</p>

    <p class="home-blurb">On campus, I'm a <strong>data reporter with the Yale Daily News</strong>, where we use open datasets to <strong>investigate campus issues</strong> and <strong>produce data visualizations</strong>. I'm also an avid musician with the <strong> Yale Symphony Orchestra </strong> as its principal clarinetist.</p>

    <p class="home-blurb">Last summer, I was a <a href="https://light.yale.edu/about/latest-fellowship-winners" style="font-weight: 600"> 2019 Light Fellow</a> in Seoul, South Korea at Sogang University. Before that, I was a musical ambassador on international tours with the <a href="https://www.carnegiehall.org/Education/Young-Musicians/National-Youth-Ensembles/NYO-USA/NYO-USA-2017"> National Youth Orchestra of the United States of America.</a>.</p>

    <div class="home-pills">More about me</div>

    <p class="home-blurb">I'm passionate about data visualization, particularly as a way of briding the gap between communities and resources. In my free time, I love to play music and cook.
