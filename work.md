## Statistics & Data science {#data-science}

{: .list-plus}

-This summer, I'm a **data science intern at <a href="https://www.hellocherish.com/"> Cherish</a>**, where I am working on creating an internal metrics board and machine learning algorithms such as `Num2vec` to assist the organization's content matching algorithms. More to come on this!
- **Wrote a comprehensive multivariate statistical report** regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications on the American healthcare system capacity. Used publicly available dataset from [Harvard Global Health Institute](https://globalepidemics.org/hospital-capacity/), using technqiues such as principal components analysis, factor analysis, and culster analysis. Received narrative commendations from professor Jonathan Reuning-Scherer for report and work in the class S&DS 363, Multivariate Statistical Methods in the Social Sciences [GitHub](https://github.com/danielk56/projects

- **Analyzed and visualized survey results** from Yale's Class of 2020 for the Yale Daily News' Commencement Special Issues edition. Distributed 20 question to over 1,000 students; cleaned, analyzed, and visualized data using `R`, `Python`, and `Tableau`. Also, working to create a piece on similarities and differences of Yale's Fourteen Residential Colleges, using student data scraped from Yale Facebook. Check out some of my work:[Story](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2020/01/10/yales-most-popular-courses/){:target="_blank" class="button inline-label-page"} [GitHub](https://github.com/danielk56/YDN

- **Conducted a randomized field experiment** on whether randomly altering the thickness and length of cane clarinet reeds affects the tone quality and intonation of the instrument. Implemented randomized experimentation in randomized field design with `R` using concepts such as average treatment effect and logistic regression to determine that "reed clipping" has a significant effect on tone quality, whereas it has minimal consequences on intonation. <span class="evidence"> </span> <span class="evidence"> [Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gaCthZn8i--5KMT99j81gLKQORrPa4koeGISuCgMym4/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank" class="button inline-label-page"} [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zd59RaqKpmRObjP6AkwsitbJwyKti2KmvvvxU4stb7o/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank" class="button inline-label-page"}</span> <span class="evidence">[GitHub](https://github.com/danielk56/LORE_final_project){:target="_blank" class="button inline-label-github"}</span>


## Nonprofit & Education Work {#nonprofit}
{: .list-plus}

-**Project Head for Yale's Restaurant Rescue Project**, a subset of the Yale Hunger and Homelessness Action Project.
-**Worked as an Undergraduate Learning Assitant for the Yale Statistics & Data Science Department**. Helped professor Joseph Chang design and grade problem sets in the Intensive Introductory Statistics course at Yale (S&DS 220). Moreover, assisted professor Sudesh Kalyanswamy grading Multivariable Calculus problem sets and extra problems over the course of the 19-20 academic year.
-**Worked with MathCounts and Yale's Education Studies Department** to work firsthand with schools in the greater New Haven community such as Edgewood STEAM Middle School. I shadowed teachers instructing mathematics and the sciences and even designed my own curriculum to prepare student for the nationwide MathCounts competition.  Worked in classrooms of size 10-20 students offering individual and group instruction.
