## Data science {#data-science}

{: .list-plus}

- **This summer, I'm a data science intern at** <a href="https://www.hellocherish.com/"><ins>Cherish</ins></a>, where I have created a trending content web tool using `Python`, `Heroku` and `Streamlit`, an open-source app framework for Data Science teams. Check out the app here: [App](https://intelligent-vin-24283.herokuapp.com/){:target="_blank" class="button inline-label-page"} I am also working on content-based recommendation algorithms and weighted ratings equations using the `Pandas` and `sklearn` libraries to assist the organization's content matching process. Carried this out using the `tf-idf` vectorizer algorithm. [TF-IDF](https://github.com/danielk56/cherish/blob/master/recommend.py){:target="_blank" class="button inline-label-github"}
- **Wrote a comprehensive multivariate statistical report** regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications on the American healthcare system capacity. Used publicly available dataset from [<ins>Harvard Global Health Institute</ins>](https://globalepidemics.org/hospital-capacity/), using technqiues such as principal components analysis, factor analysis, and culster analysis. Received narrative commendations from professor Jonathan Reuning-Scherer for report and work in the class S&DS 363, Multivariate Statistical Methods in the Social Sciences [GitHub](https://github.com/danielk56/Principal_Components_Analysis){:target="_blank" class="button inline-label-github"}
- **Produced numerous statistical projects** using techniques such as Clustering Analysis, Principal Components Analysis, and more. Check out some of my projects. Principal Components Analysis on 665 NBA players from the '16-'17 season [PCA](https://github.com/danielk56/multivariate/tree/master/Principal_Components_Analysis-master){:target="_blank" class="button inline-label-github"} Factor Analysis using datasets on pastry characteristics such as flakiness and density [Factor Analysis](https://github.com/danielk56/multivariate/tree/master/Factor_Analysis-master){:target="_blank" class="button inline-label-page"} MANOVA to look at difference in group means for OCD treatment groups [MANOVA](https://github.com/danielk56/multivariate/tree/master/MANOVA-master){:target="_blank" class="button inline-label-github"} Discriminant Analysis looking at difference in Wine Quality groups based on sun and rain quantity [Discriminant Analysis](https://github.com/danielk56/multivariate/tree/master/Discriminant_Analysis-master){:target="_blank" class="button inline-label-page"} Oordination using a dataset on major cereal brands [Oordination](https://github.com/danielk56/multivariate/tree/master/Ordination-master){:target="_blank" class="button inline-label-github"} Cluster Analysis using dataset regarding the top American higher educational institutions such as Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and more. [Cluster Analysis](https://github.com/danielk56/multivariate/tree/master/Cluster_Analysis-master){:target="_blank" class="button inline-label-github"}
- **Analyzed and visualized survey results** from Yale's Class of 2020 for the Yale Daily News' Commencement Special Issues edition. Distributed 20 question to over 1,000 students; cleaned, analyzed, and visualized data using the `dplyr` and `questionr` packages in `R` and also created interactive visualizations with `Tableau`. Also, working to create a piece on similarities and differences of Yale's Fourteen Residential Colleges, using student data scraped from Yale Facebook.

- **Conducted a randomized field experiment** on whether randomly altering the thickness and length of cane clarinet reeds affects the tone quality and intonation of the instrument. Implemented randomized experimentation in randomized field design with `R` using concepts such as average treatment effect and logistic regression to determine that "reed clipping" has a significant effect on tone quality, whereas it has minimal consequences on intonation. <span class="evidence"> </span> <span class="evidence"> [Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gaCthZn8i--5KMT99j81gLKQORrPa4koeGISuCgMym4/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank" class="button inline-label-github"} [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zd59RaqKpmRObjP6AkwsitbJwyKti2KmvvvxU4stb7o/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank" class="button inline-label-page"}</span> <span class="evidence">[GitHub](https://github.com/danielk56/LORE_final_project){:target="_blank" class="button inline-label-github"}</span>

Some places we deliver to include the Sierra Center, Sunrise Cafe, and the Roger Sherman Halfway House. As part of the third cohort of Project Heads in RRP's history, I helped expand the inclusion of New Haven's restaurants to over fifteen, garnerning the support of places such as Breugger's Bagels and Chipotle.

- **Worked as an Undergraduate Learning Assitant for the Yale Statistics & Data Science Department**. Helped professor Joseph Chang design and grade problem sets in the Intensive Introductory Statistics course at Yale (S&DS 220). Moreover, assisted professor Sudesh Kalyanswamy grading Multivariable Calculus problem sets and extra problems over the course of the 19-20 academic year.
- **Worked with MathCounts and Yale's Education Studies Department** to work firsthand with schools in the greater New Haven community such as Edgewood STEAM Middle School. I shadowed teachers instructing mathematics and the sciences and even designed my own curriculum to prepare student for the nationwide MathCounts competition.  Worked in classrooms of size 10-20 students offering individual and group instruction. Moreover, as a part of my time with the Education Studies Department, I produced a comprehensive report looking at the inequality in South Korean public versus private education, caused mainly by its intense academic academies.
