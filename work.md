## Statistics & Data science {#data-science}

{: .list-plus}

- **This summer, I'm a data science intern at** <a href="https://www.hellocherish.com/"> Cherish</a>, where I am working on creating an internal metrics board and machine learning algorithms such as `Num2vec` to assist the organization's content matching algorithms. More to come on this!
- **Wrote a comprehensive multivariate statistical report** regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications on the American healthcare system capacity. Used publicly available dataset from [Harvard Global Health Institute](https://globalepidemics.org/hospital-capacity/), using technqiues such as principal components analysis, factor analysis, and culster analysis. Received narrative commendations from professor Jonathan Reuning-Scherer for report and work in the class S&DS 363, Multivariate Statistical Methods in the Social Sciences [GitHub](https://github.com/danielk56/projects

- **Analyzed and visualized survey results** from Yale's Class of 2020 for the Yale Daily News' Commencement Special Issues edition. Distributed 20 question to over 1,000 students; cleaned, analyzed, and visualized data using `R`, `Python`, and `Tableau`. Also, working to create a piece on similarities and differences of Yale's Fourteen Residential Colleges, using student data scraped from Yale Facebook.

- **Conducted a randomized field experiment** on whether randomly altering the thickness and length of cane clarinet reeds affects the tone quality and intonation of the instrument. Implemented randomized experimentation in randomized field design with `R` using concepts such as average treatment effect and logistic regression to determine that "reed clipping" has a significant effect on tone quality, whereas it has minimal consequences on intonation. <span class="evidence"> </span> <span class="evidence"> [Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gaCthZn8i--5KMT99j81gLKQORrPa4koeGISuCgMym4/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank" class="button inline-label-page"} [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zd59RaqKpmRObjP6AkwsitbJwyKti2KmvvvxU4stb7o/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank" class="button inline-label-page"}</span> <span class="evidence">[GitHub](https://github.com/danielk56/LORE_final_project){:target="_blank" class="button inline-label-github"}</span>

- **Project Head for Yale's Restaurant Rescue Project**, a subset of the Yale Hunger and Homelessness Action Project. Restaurant Rescue Project is an organization that provides New Haven Restaurant with volunteer deliverers to transport leftover food to places in need. Some places we deliver to include the Sierra Center, Sunrise Cafe, and the Roger Sherman Halfway House. As part of the third cohort of Project Heads in RRP's history, I helped expand the inclusion of New Haven's restaurants to over fifteen, garnerning the support of places such as Breugger's Bagels and Chipotle. I have also overseen the delivery of hundreds of pounds of food during my two semesters as project head.

- **Worked as an Undergraduate Learning Assitant for the Yale Statistics & Data Science Department**. Helped professor Joseph Chang design and grade problem sets in the Intensive Introductory Statistics course at Yale (S&DS 220). Moreover, assisted professor Sudesh Kalyanswamy grading Multivariable Calculus problem sets and extra problems over the course of the 19-20 academic year.
- **Worked with MathCounts and Yale's Education Studies Department** to work firsthand with schools in the greater New Haven community such as Edgewood STEAM Middle School. I shadowed teachers instructing mathematics and the sciences and even designed my own curriculum to prepare student for the nationwide MathCounts competition.  Worked in classrooms of size 10-20 students offering individual and group instruction. Moreover, as a part of my time with the Education Studies Department, I produced a comprehensive report looking at the inequality in South Korean public versus private education, caused mainly by its intense academic academies.
