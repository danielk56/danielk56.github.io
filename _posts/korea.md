During the summer of 2019, I had the privilege of studying at Sogang University's Korean Language Education Center under Yale's Light Fellowship. The Richard U. Light Fellowship Program fully funds Yale undergraduate, graduate, and professional school students pursuing intensive language study in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean for terms ranging from a single summer to a combined summer plus academic year. Light Fellows undertake rigorous language training alongside intense cultural immersion. Along the way, I made wonderful friends, learned valuable lessons, had unforgettable experiences, and ate amazing food. One of the best experiences of my life for sure. 

During my time there, I documented my travels week by week. If you're interested, check out my blog [here]!
