Hi! I'm Daniel!

Iâ€™m a junior at Yale University, in New Haven, Connecticut, studying <span class="evidence"> 
statistics & data science</span>. I'm passionate about data, particularly in its role as acting 
as a force for tangible change. This summer, I'm a  <strong> data science intern at <a href="https://www.hellocherish.com/"> 
Cherish </strong> </a>, a startup company aiming on providing accessible training and coaching for parents of teeangers.
